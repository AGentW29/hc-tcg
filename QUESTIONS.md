	- You can use effect when you don't have enough items
	- The damage from effect is added to the hermit attacks for one total value
		- That is important becasue armor last until hermit is knocked
# Is not having any items left in pile really a lose condition? Or can the player try to play until he dies without getting mroe cards?

	- Beef confirms you close when you run out of cards
	- I would still play until death instead in my version though
# Can you use damage effect (on its own without using hermit attack) and still change active hermit?
# How does armor work if the attack is less than the full armor?
# Can you have the same hermit (same rarirty) twice in your deck?
	- Yes - Here Xisuma has 2x the same Joe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brrgsGNJ2Wg&t=0s
# Can you have the same effect twice in your deck?
