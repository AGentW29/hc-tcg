# Should sword effect deal damage immedaitely or as part of player attack (what if he doesn't attack?)

	- You can use effect when you don't have enough items
	- The damage from effect is added to the hermit attacks for one total value
		- That is important becasue armor last until hermit is knocked
# Is not having any items left in pile really a lose condition? Or can the player try to play until he dies without getting mroe cards?

	- Beef confirms you close when you run out of cards
	- I would still play until death instead in my version though
# Can you use damage effect (on its own without using hermit attack) and still change active hermit?
	- No - (beef reply on twitter)
# Can you have the same hermit (same rarity) twice in your deck?
	- Yes - Here Xisuma has 2x the same Joe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brrgsGNJ2Wg&t=0s
	- Still doubt tho
# Can you heal past max hp?
	- No -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brrgsGNJ2Wg&t=0s 1:02:35
# Does emerald work only on items on board or only in hand? If you have no effect card can you get opponent card without giving anything back?
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhrjGkE2leQ&t=1236s - 14:40 - should work on items on board, you need to have a card of your own
	- It seems beef changed it form item to efect card (yes, EP41 6:40)
# Can Lead be used on your items? 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhrjGkE2leQ&t=1236s - 12:20 - says yes
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiOUq2DsWKw&t=21s - 12:10 - says no
# Does Bed restore full health instantly or once the two turns pass?
# Crossbow - Are weaknesses applied to the damage to afk hermits (so 30dmg instead of 10?) If so if both active or afk hermit are weak do both receive extra 20dmg?
# When I kill myself using TNT attack (or thorns/wolf), should I pick new active hermit this turn or wait for the next one?
# Does Bed sleeping activate after turn ends or immediately (so player can't attack in the turn he used the bed?)
# What happens when a sleeping hermit (bed effect) gets his bad stolen using an emerald or Grian?
# Does game end even when you use effect cards to draw more cards or only at end of a turn?
# Can you use composter if there is not enough cards in your hand?
# When Mending is used, does the single use card return to end of players deck or at random spot?
# Does Mending work only when attached to active hermit, or even when it is attached to an afk hermit?
# Do special moves - like Ethos blue fire or docs double damage - also affect afk hermit if e.g. used together with bow?
# Does fortune affect all coin flips for special moves that have multiple coin flips? Like ultra rare Etho's "Slab" attack?
# Does chorus fruit/cub overwrite curse of binding?
# Does chorus fruit/cub overwrite knockback?
# Does Gems rare ability to use additional effect include offensive single use cards? E.g. can I attack again with a sword?
# Does Grian's borrow steal gold_armor/shield before attack, or is it destroyed before he can steal it?
# When scar uses shis deathloop ability and also holds a totem, should the totem be removed or stay when knocked out?
# Using Hypno & Bow/Crossbow, can I decide to attack two different afk hermits?
# When I use Efficiency with Hypno without any items, can I still attack an AFK hermit?
# What does it mean that "attack misses" for Pearl's special move. Does it just mean damage is 0, or that also special move actions won't happen? (e.g. etho's blue fire is not applied)
# Zedaph's ability - does the seocnd coin flip happen on attack on start of a turn (so that oppopnent knows NOT to attack).
# Zedaph's ability - does the back damage also include damage to afk hermits (e.g. from bow/crossbow)
# Zedaph's ability - does the back damage include both the 20 & 60 from TNT attack?
